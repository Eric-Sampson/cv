                <p> <strong> Fullstack Developer/Marketing Agent at <em>DEBIMA LLC</em></strong></p>
                
                <p>I have been involved in various levels of teaching both in the High School level and University level immediately after my Bachelor in Engineering but felt the need for more practical knowledge. </p>

                <p>I currently work with DEBIMA the premier <strong> Full Stack Development and Digital Marketting Agency</strong> located in Douala, Cameroon. </p> 

                <p>DEBIMA LLC handles numerous Front-end and Back-end Development projects and also runs a DEBIMA Academy preparing its Staff and the general public for the job. This means i work in an environment where learning is second nature which is essential for the ever expanding ICT discipline.</p>
                <p>I also double as the <strong><em>Marketing Agent</em></strong> for DEBIMA which pretty much exposes me to every stage of the production cycle of DEBIMA giving me a holistic view of not just the production but the deployment of Software technologies.</p>
